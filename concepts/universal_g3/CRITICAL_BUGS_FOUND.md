# Critical Bugs Found in Production G³ Solver

## Date: 2025-09-23
## Analysis performed on RTX 5090 GPU

## Summary
The production G³ solver (`solve_g3_production.py`) has several critical bugs that prevent it from working correctly:

### Bug 1: Smoothing Kernel Boundary Condition Error
**Location:** Lines 148-149 in `gauss_seidel_rb_kernel`
```cuda
if (i >= nx-2 || j >= ny-2 || k >= nz-2) return;
if (i < 1 || j < 1 || k < 1) return;
```

**Problem:** The kernel excludes too many boundary points. It should update points from (1, 1, 1) to (nx-2, ny-2, nz-2), but the condition `i >= nx-2` means it stops at nx-3, missing the second-to-last row/column/layer.

**Fix:** Change to:
```cuda
if (i >= nx-1 || j >= ny-1 || k >= nz-1) return;
if (i < 1 || j < 1 || k < 1) return;
```

### Bug 2: Effective Core Radius Not Used
**Location:** The `rc_eff` parameter is computed (line 565) but never used in the PDE solver.

**Problem:** The core radius parameter `rc_kpc` and its effective value `rc_eff` don't affect the solution at all. They should modulate the gravitational coupling spatially.

**Fix:** The mobility computation or the source term should incorporate `rc_eff` to create a spatially varying coupling strength.

### Bug 3: S0_eff Not Properly Applied
**Location:** While `S0_eff` is passed to the solver, the implementation doesn't correctly apply it, resulting in identical solutions regardless of S0 value.

**Problem:** Even though S0_eff varies, all solutions give the same chi-squared, indicating the coupling strength isn't actually affecting the gravitational field.

## Test Results

### Test 1: Parameter Variation
- Varied S0 from 0.1 to 10.0
- S0_eff ranged from 0.0441 to 4.4147
- **Result:** χ²/dof = 66.16 for ALL values (should differ!)

### Test 2: Solution Analysis
- Input: Non-zero density distribution
- **Result:** 
  - Potential (phi): ALL ZEROS
  - Gradient magnitude: ALL ZEROS
  - Acceleration: ALL ZEROS

### Test 3: Convergence Behavior
- Solver claims convergence after 2 cycles
- Residual remains at 1.0 (no improvement)
- No actual solving happening

## Impact on Analysis

1. **Optimization doesn't work** because changing parameters doesn't affect the solution
2. **All galaxies get the same chi-squared** regardless of parameters
3. **Rotation curves are meaningless** (all zeros or constant)
4. **Parameter studies are invalid** since parameters don't affect results

## Immediate Actions Required

1. Fix the smoothing kernel boundary conditions
2. Implement proper use of rc_eff in the PDE
3. Verify S0_eff is correctly applied in the source term
4. Add unit tests for kernel functions
5. Validate against analytical solutions

## Verification Tests

After fixing, verify with:
1. Simple point mass (should give 1/r potential)
2. Uniform sphere (should give known analytical solution)
3. Parameter sweep (should show different solutions for different S0)
4. Boundary condition test (non-zero potential near boundaries)

## Additional Bug Found

### Bug 4: RawKernel Execution Issue
**Testing Date:** 2025-09-23 20:27

**Problem:** The CUDA kernels compile but don't execute properly when launched via cp.RawKernel. The kernels are being called but produce no output (all zeros).

**Evidence:**
- ElementwiseKernel works correctly
- ReductionKernel works correctly  
- RawModule works correctly
- But RawKernel with the same code pattern produces zeros

**Likely Cause:** The issue appears to be with how the kernel is being launched or with the kernel code formatting/escaping.

## Workaround

Until fixed, DO NOT USE `solve_g3_production.py` for any analysis. The solver needs to be completely rewritten using either:
1. RawModule instead of RawKernel (recommended)
2. ElementwiseKernel for simple operations
3. A validated CPU implementation first, then GPU optimization
