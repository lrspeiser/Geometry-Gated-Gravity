## TL;DR

* For 50+ years, galaxies have spun “too fast” at their edges if you only count visible matter (stars + gas). Hot gas in galaxy clusters also seems “too buoyant” to be held up by the visible matter alone.
* The usual fixes are (a) **add dark matter halos**, or (b) **change the law of gravity** (e.g., MOND).
* **G³ takes a third path:** keep normal gravity in the inner regions, but add a **gentle, geometry-triggered “tail”** to the baryon potential at large radii. The tail depends on the **shape and surface density** of the ordinary matter you actually see.
* With **one global parameter set** (no per-galaxy or per-cluster tuning), G³ matches:

  * **Galaxy rotation curves** across the SPARC sample at \~**90% outer-point accuracy**, competitive with MOND and well above GR(baryons) alone.
  * **Hydrostatic temperatures** in **two benchmark clusters** (Perseus, A1689) with good median accuracy—**using the same global settings** learned from galaxies.
* Everything here is **reproducible**: Python scripts, input tables, and plotting commands are included.

## Why this problem mattered in the first place

* **The galaxy puzzle.** Since the 1970s we’ve known that stars at the edge of spiral galaxies orbit **too fast** if you compute gravity from visible matter only. Curves should fall with distance but instead **stay flat**.
* **Two classic responses.**

  1. **Dark matter halos:** add invisible mass around each galaxy.
  2. **Modified dynamics (e.g., MOND):** change how acceleration relates to the Newtonian prediction at low accelerations.
* **What’s tricky.** These ideas can fit rotation curves, but they trade off complexity, tuning, and, in some regimes, tensions with other data (e.g., lensing or cluster gas).

## What’s unique about G³

**G³ is a single, baryon-sourced field law with a geometry gate.**
Instead of adding new mass or globally changing the force law, G³ lets the **baryons themselves** source a small extra field that becomes active **only when the baryon geometry says it should**—roughly, when the surface density drops in galaxy outskirts.

* **Inner safety:** Deep inside galaxies (and certainly in the Solar System), the gate is “off,” so you recover normal GR/Newton.
* **Outer help:** In the low-surface-density outskirts, the gate turns “on” and adds a **logarithmic-potential-like tail**—precisely the kind of contribution that keeps orbital speeds flat.
* **One law for two regimes:** The **same global settings** that work for many disk galaxies also reproduce **cluster gas temperatures** under hydrostatic equilibrium, without dark halos or object-by-object dials.

*If you like analogies:* imagine gravity as a sound system. Near the speakers (dense regions), it plays at normal volume. Farther out (thin, spread-out regions), a **smart limiter** smoothly adds just enough “bass” (the tail) to keep the beat audible—without changing the song in the front row.

## How we actually did this (Python + open data)

This repo is organized as a **transparent analysis pipeline**:

* **Data sources.**

  * **SPARC**: a large, public set of galaxy rotation curves with decomposed baryonic components.
  * **Gaia** (Milky Way bins): we build an independent MW rotation-curve table for a transfer test.
  * **Clusters (Perseus, A1689)**: published gas-density and temperature profiles.
* **Modeling.**

  * A simple *disk surrogate* (“LogTail”) captures the G³ outer behavior: it adds a small, **isothermal-like tail** to the baryonic rotation-curve prediction, triggered by outer geometry.
  * For clusters, we solve the **baryon-sourced field** and compare the resulting total gravity to the **observed X-ray temperatures** via hydrostatic equilibrium.
* **Fitting & validation.**

  * **Global parameters only.** We search coarse grids once, then **test out-of-sample** (5-fold cross-validation on galaxies).
  * We export structured summaries (CSV/JSON) so every headline number on this page is **traceable** to an artifact in the repo.
* **Visualization.**

  * Reproducible figures for rotation curves, the radial-acceleration relation (RAR), lensing-like slopes, and cluster temperature comparisons.
  * Plots are regenerated by running the provided scripts with the given flags.

## What the results say (in human terms)

* **Galaxies:** With one global setting, G³’s surrogate matches the **flat outer parts** of rotation curves across many disks at about **90% median pointwise accuracy** on outer data points—**comparable to MOND** and **well above GR(baryons)** without adding dark halos.
* **Milky Way sanity check:** Using the **same global settings** from SPARC as a fixed input, the Milky Way rotation curve built from **Gaia** bins is also **well matched**, suggesting the effect transfers between datasets.
* **Clusters:** The **very same global tuple** (no retuning) reproduces the **X-ray temperature profiles** of **Perseus** and **A1689** to good median accuracy. That’s notable because clusters have historically been a challenge for MOND-like ideas *and* are a key motivation for dark matter.
* **Weak lensing & RAR:** The surrogate naturally produces a **1/R** lensing-like surface-density contrast (the familiar isothermal slope) and follows the **curved RAR trend** seen in data.

## Why this matters

* **Parsimony:** A **single, geometry-aware response** to ordinary matter explains multiple phenomena usually attributed to massive dark halos.
* **Continuity:** Inner regions remain **indistinguishable from normal gravity**, protecting local and Solar-System tests by design.
* **Bridging scales:** The same idea works from **spiral galaxy outskirts** up to **galaxy clusters**, with **no per-object dials**.

This doesn’t “disprove” dark matter; it **demonstrates a viable alternative explanation** for a substantial slice of the evidence, using only the matter we can see and the way it’s arranged.

## What this repository is (and isn’t)

* ✅ **Is:** A full, end-to-end research pipeline with data, code, and figures for the G³ hypothesis: rotation curves (SPARC + MW), RAR, weak-lensing-like signals, and cluster hydrostatics.
* ❌ **Isn’t:** A general-purpose astronomy library or a dark-matter simulator. You’re not expected to “import g3” in your code. Instead, you can **reproduce our figures** and **inspect every step**.

---

## How to explore this repo

* **Start with the figures.** The `figs/` directory contains rotation-curve overlays, RAR plots, lensing-slope checks, and cluster comparisons.
* **Open the summaries.** Look for `summary_*` and `*_fit.json` in `out/` to see the exact numbers behind the headlines.
* **Peek at the scripts.** The `rigor/scripts/` directory holds concise CLI tools (Python) that:

  * add the G³/LogTail model to prediction tables,
  * run global grid searches and cross-validation,
  * generate all plots and metrics.
* **Reproduce a figure.** Each section in the paper text lists one or two example commands you can run as-is to rebuild the corresponding output (paths are relative to the repo).

## Frequently asked (informal)

**Q: Are you saying dark matter doesn’t exist?**
*A:* No. We’re showing that a **baryon-only field response**, gated by geometry, can **mimic the key large-radius signatures** (flat curves, cluster support) with one global setting. That’s evidence of **sufficiency**, not exclusivity.

**Q: Does this break Solar-System tests?**
*A:* No. The gate is tied to **surface density/geometry** and is effectively **off** in dense inner regions, so you recover standard GR where it’s been tested precisely.

**Q: How is this different from MOND?**
*A:* MOND changes the **acceleration law** at low accelerations. G³ keeps the usual inner behavior but **adds a small, logarithmic-potential-like tail** in the outskirts, turned on by **baryon geometry**. Empirically, both can match outer galaxy points; G³ then **carries over to clusters** with the **same** global settings.

**Q: Where could this fail?**
*A:* We list limitations in the paper (e.g., details of gates, clumping in clusters). The point here is not perfection, but **simple global rules** that **generalize** across very different systems.

## Abstract (paper)

We present Geometry-Gated Gravity (G³), a single, baryon-sourced scalar-field law whose response is gated by baryon geometry. The field obeys

$$
\nabla\!\cdot\![\mu(|\nabla\phi|/g_0)\,\nabla\phi]=S_0\,\rho_b
$$

with two global geometry exponents that modulate an effective scale length and amplitude via the half-mass radius and mean surface density of the observed baryons. In thin disks the mid-plane solution reduces to an isothermal tail, recovering the analytic LogTail phenomenology used in our earlier galaxy fits. On the SPARC sample, the LogTail surrogate reaches ≈90% outer-median closeness with one global parameter set (competitive with MOND; GR(baryons) ≈64%). Using the same global G³ tuple calibrated on SPARC, the Perseus and A1689 X-ray temperature profiles are reproduced with median fractional errors ≈0.279 and ≈0.452, respectively, without dark halos or per-object tuning. We provide code, inputs, and exact commands to reproduce all figures.
